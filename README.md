- 👋 Hi, I’m @Craye369
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to write and understand code...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be patient.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping me get control of my device back. My ex wrote software, apps and all sorts of things and has all this locked into my phone. He's using it to stalk and torment me. It's devious and sick and I need help! It's taken me about 7 or so months and endless hours tracking data from a Google takeout backwards to find what I have. I'm nothing more than a recovering addict who spent time locked up from my addiction and choices. I'm working hard to get my life back together and this man is messing with me, stealing from me and just flat out tracking me.I have 30 sensors and 19 satellites that are constantly keeping track of me and even how much pressure I use while holding my phone. Desperately seeking a hero💯.
- 📫 How to reach me plain420raye@gmail.com is the best way to reach me, any help would be greatly appreciated cuz I really have no idea what I'm doing.
